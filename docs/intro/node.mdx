<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
With ValQ, you can build a model of your business process and view it in the form of a tree as well as a table. Toggle between the below icons 
present on the top left corner of the canvas to change the view.  
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node8.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div>

## Tree View

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The tree structure is presented in a  horizontal format as a visual.  Just like a tree,
ValQ model has a stem on Top called Top node and the Top node then branches out to other nodes. 
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node7.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div>
<br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The model is segmented into levels starting from level 1 with Top node, here it's 'Overall Result'. The nodes share a parent-child relationship at each level.
For example, the 'East' node is the Parent node while 'Consumer' node is a Child node, 'Consumer' node is the Parent node while 'Chris Morris' node is a Child node. 
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node2.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div> <br />

Click on '>' to expand and '<' collapse levels.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node6.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div> <br />

You can also use the 'Go to level ^' option present on the bottom of the canvas to navigate between levels of the tree.

  </Zoom>    
</div>

## Table View

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The same information can be viewed in tabular form as see in the image below. The Table view is generally used to plan and analyze the data.
Click on the table icon as highlighted below to get the tabular view.
</div> <br />

## Node Components

Now let's take a look at what makes up a node.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node4.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div>
<br />

Each node represents a value driver, KPI or category and it's several performance metrics. Here's how to interpret a node:

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}} className="table-center">

|   |   Component	| Description  	|
|---    |---	|---	|
|1| Node name  	| Name of the value driver or KPI	|
|2| Conditional Formatting  	| Color band indicating the variance 	|
|3| Value Trend 	| A sparkline graph showing the trend |
|4| Baseline Value  	| Node value of the baseline series |
|5| Variance for all periods  	| Full year variance of the node |
|6| Variance for current period  	| Current month (usually first period in the series) month variance of the node |
|7| Absolute Variance  | Variance showed in absolute value |
|8| Percentage Variance  	| Variance showed in percentage |

</div> <br />

> **Note** <br />
Variance is calculated as the difference between the Baseline series and Comparison series

Baseline series is the primary series and Comparison series is the benchmark against which the Baseline is compared.
Here the Sales Budget is the Baseline series and Sales Forecast is the Comparison series.

The second option in the Analyze tab is Attribution Analysis in which you can analyse the 
contribution of different key performance indicators and key inputs to the simulated results of an outcome.

On clicking the 'Attribution Analysis' option, you'll be able to see the following screen.

There are three parts in this screen - toolbar, waterfall chart and table.

## 1. Waterfall Chart

On the left is the waterfall chart in which you can see how the simulated KPIs contribute to the change 
in the outcome KPI. Click on the full screen option at the bottom to enter the full screen mode.

As you hover over the bars, you can see the simulation impact, actual and simulated values.

You can toggle between horizontal and vertical waterfall charts using the options on the top right.

## 2. Table

On the right in the main screen is the table which contains some additional information. 
You can see the baseline and simulated values of the outcome KPI, and the variance in both absolute and 
percentage terms.

Immediately below this, you'll find a list of the KPIs and their baseline and simulated values. 
Simulation impact, Attribution% and Contribution% are also shown.

You can hide/unhide units and contribution% using the checkboxes on the top.
